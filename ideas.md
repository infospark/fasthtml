Using the model
---------------
When I ask a question of the kg i see the 'neuron fire' - i can see the context it used to answer the question but in graphical form
Building a model of an organisation in the 'brain' of the application

Could we use a nano banana to make a chart from within our app so you would just say could you please plot this data against these different axis and it just draws a chart for you in a certain style?

Building the model
-----------------

When you drag a document into the diagram the first thing it does is show a picture of the document and then show itself breaking the document down and then things start to pop out of the document into the wider diagram 

It's a value in somehow building this bottle but then running it so simulate the flow of information of putting a piece in somewhere and seeing where it goes for example changing a bit of the model and seeing how the flow of information
So the writing of information to the knowledge graph is like a form of continual learning and could be phrase such so that it learns from one document and then you provide another and it built on the knowledge from the first document to incorporate from the second one and continually learn more and more about your business of what kind of information you add to it continue learning


Getting source/demo docs
------------------------
So don't go looking for documents with the specific use case in mind rather convert that and look for documents with something valuable in them that is hard to comprehend in the aggregate and instead focus that the use case on that and then see if there's somebody who wants that solving well then specifically looking for documents that satisfy some narrow use case which may not exist
